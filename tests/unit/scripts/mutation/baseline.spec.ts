/**
 * `scripts/mutation/baseline.ts` — the per-file mutation ratchet.
 *
 * This is a GATE, so its own logic has to be right: a ratchet that silently re-records a
 * regression is worse than no ratchet, because it looks like one. The asymmetry is the whole
 * design and it is what these cases pin —
 *
 *   improvements move the baseline UP, regressions never move it DOWN.
 *
 * Driven against synthetic reports rather than a real Stryker run, for the same reason the
 * spec-identity tests use temp directories: the logic must be testable without a long
 * mutation run, and a test that needed one would never be run.
