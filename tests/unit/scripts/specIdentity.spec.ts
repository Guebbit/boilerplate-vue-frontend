/**
 * `scripts/specIdentity.ts` — the cross-repo contract check.
 *
 * Two separate things are worth testing here, and only one of them is the comparison logic:
 *
 *  1. **The logic**, against fixtures on a temp directory. It has to work when the sibling
 *     checkout is absent, which is the state of every CI runner that has not checked it out and
 *     of every copy of this boilerplate cloned on its own — so it is driven against synthetic
 *     roots rather than the real neighbouring repo. A test that needed the sibling present would
 *     be the one thing that cannot run where the check matters most.
 *
 *  2. **The real pair**, when the sibling actually is beside this checkout. That case is
 *     conditional on purpose: it is the live assertion that the two repos agree today, and it is
 *     the only one that would notice a fork introduced by hand. Where the sibling is missing it
 *     reports as skipped rather than passing quietly, because a check that silently evaporates is
 *     worse than one that is visibly absent.
 *
 * The fixtures are built from `SHARED_FILES` rather than from a hardcoded list, so a file added
 * to the check is covered by every case below without touching this file — and, more to the
 * point, cannot be added *without* being covered.
 *
 * Mirrors `tests/unit/scripts/spec-identity.test.ts` in the backend.
