/**
 * The cross-repo contract check.
 *
 * A set of files exists in BOTH this repo and the paired backend, byte-for-byte identical,
 * maintained by hand. Codegen on both sides reads the specs among them — orval and the AsyncAPI
 * type generator here, orval and `gen-asyncapi-types` there — so a one-line edit in one checkout
 * silently forks what both sides believe they share. Nothing detected that: each repo's
 * CI lints its own copy and finds it perfectly valid, because a forked spec is still a valid spec.
 *
 * This module is the detector. It is deliberately dumber than a semantic diff: identity, not
 * equivalence. Two specs that mean the same thing but differ in key order or comments are still a
 * fork in the making, because the next person to regenerate from one of them gets a diff nobody
 * asked for. Reordering both copies together is a two-line change; letting them drift is not.
 *
 * It treats the symptom, and should say so: the cure is one source of truth — a package both
 * repos consume, or a third repo — which is a bigger decision than a CI job. Until that is made,
 * this fails the build on the commit that forks a shared file rather than on the release that
 * ships the mismatch.
 *
 * The backend mirrors this file. The two are separate copies on purpose: a shared package would
 * itself be a cross-repo dependency, which is the problem rather than the fix. Only `THIS_REPO`
 * differs between them — the file list is identical, so a file added on one side is a one-line
 * copy on the other rather than a translation.

 * The files that must be identical in both checkouts.
 *
 * The test is not "are these the same today" — a dozen more files happen to match, from favicons
 * to `.prettierrc` — but "does a fork cause a silent bug". Everything here fails quietly: the two
 * sides keep building, keep passing their own suites, and disagree only in production or in a
 * live-API run.
 *
 * `spectral.yaml` is here alongside the specs because it is the ruleset both `lint:openapi` jobs
 * enforce: if the two repos lint the same document under different rules, one of them passes a
 * spec the other would reject.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here: `public/favicon/*`, `.prettierrc`, `.dockerignore`, `.husky/*`,
 * `.docker/nginx.docs.conf` and `docs/.vitepress/theme/*`. They are identical by convention, not
 * by requirement — either repo may legitimately change its own icon or formatting width, and a
 * gate that fails on that trains people to ignore it.
 *
 * THREE OF THESE ARE PRODUCED IN THE BACKEND and copied here — the two specs, the demo dataset and
 * the analytics names. The async contract is the one whose name differs in transit: it is
 * `asyncapi.public.yaml` there and lands as `asyncapi.yaml` here, because the shared subset is the
 * whole of the async contract as far as this repo is concerned. Every one of them covers every domain, so every one is produced there from
 * per-module sources: the specs and the analytics names by assembling fragments
 * (`npm run contracts:bundle`), the dataset by seeding a database and reading it back
 * (`npm run seed:export`). For those, "decide which side is right" has one answer: the backend's,
 * because this repo's copy is an output. Editing the copy is the failure this list is worst at
 * describing and best at catching — the next regeneration reverts it, and the diff looks like the
 * backend broke something.
 *
 * Nothing that either repo can REGENERATE from a file already in this list belongs here. Such a
 * copy carries no fact the list does not already compare, and every entry costs a manual step per
 * contract change. The generated realtime types and the backend's `contract.<tool>.*` collections
 * are both out for that reason; each is guarded instead by a freshness check inside its own repo.
