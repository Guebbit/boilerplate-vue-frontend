/**
 * The per-file mutation ratchet.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Stryker's `thresholds` are GLOBAL — `high`, `low`, `break`, and nothing else. There is no
 * per-file threshold. So a single `break` over a whole `mutate` scope has exactly the failure mode
 * that directory-shaped coverage thresholds have one level down: a strong file carries a weak one,
 * and the number that passes the gate is an average nobody can act on.
 *
 * That matters most precisely when `mutate` is widened to cover everything, which is the direction
 * this repo is going. A wider scope makes the pooled average LESS informative, not more.
 *
 * ── What it does ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A ratchet, not a wall. `mutation-baseline.json` records what each file scored on a real run.
 * Afterwards:
 *
 *   - a file that DROPS below its recorded score fails the check;
 *   - a file that IMPROVES has its baseline rewritten upward (`--update`), so the gain is locked
 *     in and cannot silently be given back;
 *   - a NEW file is recorded at whatever it first measures, with an explicit entry — including
 *     `0`. An honest zero on the record beats a zero hidden in an average, and it means a file
 *     arriving untested is visible in a diff rather than absorbed by the pool.
 *
 * Nothing here ever lowers a baseline on its own. Lowering one is a decision a person makes, in a
 * commit, with a reason — which is the same rule the `break` threshold already carries.
 *
 * ── The tolerance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `SCORE_TOLERANCE` is not slack, it is a measurement error bar. Some mutants HANG rather than
 * fail, and whether Stryker records one as a timeout (counted as killed) or as a survivor depends
 * on how loaded the machine is — `stryker.config.json` documents this for
 * `src/infrastructure/http/index.ts` in the frontend. Without a tolerance the ratchet would fail on
 * machine load, and a gate that fails randomly gets switched off. It is deliberately small: a real
 * regression moves a file by far more than a rounding of the timeout race.
 *
 * ── Re-baselining ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * When `mutate` changes, the POPULATION changes, and old and new numbers are not measurements of
 * the same thing. `--update` in the same commit as the `mutate` change is the sanctioned way to
 * re-record; at any other time an unexplained baseline rewrite should be questioned in review.
 *
 * The backend mirrors this file.
