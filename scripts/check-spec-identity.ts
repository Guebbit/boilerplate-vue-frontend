/**
 * CLI for the cross-repo contract check — `npm run check:spec-identity`.
 *
 * Wired into `ci.yml` (which checks out the sibling repo first) and available locally, where the
 * sibling is the neighbouring directory the whole live-e2e setup already assumes.
 *
 * Exit codes are the interface: 0 when the contracts are identical, 1 when they have forked or a
 * file is missing, 2 when the sibling checkout could not be found at all. The last one is
 * separated because it is an environment problem rather than a contract problem, and a copy of
 * this boilerplate cloned on its own should say "I cannot see the other repo", not "your specs
 * have drifted".
