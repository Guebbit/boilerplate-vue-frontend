/**
 * CLI for the cross-repo contract check — `npm run check:spec-identity`.
 *
 * Wired into `ci.yml` (which checks out the sibling repo first and passes `BACKEND_PATH`), into
 * `npm run complete`, and available on its own.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE SIBLING PATH COMES FROM ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `BACKEND_PATH`, read from the environment or from `.env` — `process.loadEnvFile()` is Node's own,
 * so a standalone script gets the same variable the app does without a dotenv dependency. Unset, it
 * falls back to the sibling-directory convention `backendPath.ts` documents.
 *
 * ── EXIT CODES ARE THE INTERFACE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   0  the contracts are identical — or the sibling is absent and this is a developer's machine
 *   1  they have forked, or a shared file is missing on one side
 *   2  the sibling checkout could not be found, and we are somewhere that should have one
 *
 * `2` is separated from `1` because it is an environment problem rather than a contract problem: a
 * copy of this boilerplate cloned on its own should say "I cannot see the other repo", not "your
 * specs have drifted".
 *
 * ── WHY A MISSING SIBLING IS NOT FATAL LOCALLY, AND IS IN CI ─────────────────────────────────────
 * This check is part of `npm run complete`, which is the pre-commit gate. Hard-failing there would
 * make the gate unusable for anyone who cloned one half of the pair, so a missing sibling prints
 * what to do and exits 0.
 *
 * That leniency is exactly how a check quietly stops running, which is why it is switched off in
 * CI: `CI` is set by GitHub Actions (and by every other runner), and there a missing sibling means
 * the workflow is misconfigured — `ci.yml` checks the repo out itself before calling this. So the
 * one place where "no sibling" could hide a real fork is the one place it stays fatal.
