/**
 * The cross-repo contract check.
 *
 * A set of files exists in BOTH this repo and the paired backend, byte-for-byte identical,
 * maintained by hand. Codegen on both sides reads the specs among them — orval and the AsyncAPI
 * type generator here, orval and `gen-asyncapi-types` there — so a one-line edit in one checkout
 * silently forks what both sides believe they share. Nothing detected that: each repo's
 * CI lints its own copy and finds it perfectly valid, because a forked spec is still a valid spec.
 *
 * This module is the detector. It is deliberately dumber than a semantic diff: identity, not
 * equivalence. Two specs that mean the same thing but differ in key order or comments are still a
 * fork in the making, because the next person to regenerate from one of them gets a diff nobody
 * asked for. Reordering both copies together is a two-line change; letting them drift is not.
 *
 * It treats the symptom, and should say so: the cure is one source of truth — a package both
 * repos consume, or a third repo — which is a bigger decision than a CI job (see
 * BETTER_TESTS_PLAN.md §11.5). Until that is made, this fails the build on the commit that forks
 * a shared file rather than on the release that ships the mismatch.
 *
 * The backend mirrors this file. The two are separate copies on purpose: a shared package would
 * itself be a cross-repo dependency, which is the problem rather than the fix. Only `THIS_REPO`
 * differs between them — the file list is identical, so a file added on one side is a one-line
 * copy on the other rather than a translation.
