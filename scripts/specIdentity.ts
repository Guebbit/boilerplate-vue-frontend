/**
 * The cross-repo contract check.
 *
 * `openapi.yaml`, `asyncapi.yaml` and `spectral.yaml` exist in BOTH this repo and the paired
 * backend, byte-for-byte identical, maintained by hand. Two codegen pipelines read them — orval
 * here, orval and the AsyncAPI type generator there — so a one-line edit in one checkout silently
 * forks the contract both sides believe they share. Nothing detected that: each repo's own CI
 * lints its own copy and finds it perfectly valid, because a forked spec is still a valid spec.
 *
 * This module is the detector. It is deliberately dumber than a semantic diff: identity, not
 * equivalence. Two specs that mean the same thing but differ in key order or comments are still a
 * fork in the making, because the next person to regenerate from one of them gets a diff nobody
 * asked for. Reordering both copies together is a two-line change; letting them drift is not.
 *
 * It is a treatment for the symptom, and the header of this file should say so: the cure is one
 * source of truth — a package both repos consume, or a third repo — which is a bigger decision
 * than a CI job (see BETTER_TESTS_PLAN.md §11.5). Until that is made, this fails the build on the
 * commit that forks the spec instead of on the release that ships the mismatch.
 *
 * The backend mirrors this file. The two are separate copies on purpose: a shared package would
 * itself be a cross-repo dependency, which is the problem, not the fix.
